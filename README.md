# landing-page-project
My personal landing page, created using mainly HTMl and CSs Flexbox.

This was built as part of my "The Odin Project" journey.

What i've learned from doing this landing page:
- How to get the things in the right place and right order using flexbox.

- How to set heights using the property "min-height", giving the page a little responsivity.

- How to use Git to do atomic commits.
